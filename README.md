# Coursera: Developing Data Products Course Project
>This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

## My Shiny Application
I turned my Shiny app into a web page using RStudioâ€™s hosting service for Shiny apps - shinyapps.io.
You can access my app with the URL here: [http://kojikami.shinyapps.io/us-population-by-state](http://kojikami.shinyapps.io/us-population-by-state):

#### Application Descriptions
* It loads the dataset for US population from 2000 to 2010
* You can interact with the model using Sliders on the left side
* Based on the Year selected, the map and the table will show the result reactively
* Google Geo Chart with R is used for controlling inputs/outputs

#### A little more Description on gvisGeoChart
The gvisGeoChart function reads a data.frame and creates text output referring to the Google Visualisation API, which can be included into a web page, or as a stand-alone page.
*Usage*
`gvisGeoChart(data, locationvar = "", colorvar = "", sizevar = "",
  hovervar = "", options = list(), chartid)`

## My Reproducible Pitch


## Coursera Assignment Description
>Shiny Application
>1.Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
>
>2.Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
>
>3.Share the application link by pasting it into the text box below
>
>4.Share your server.R and ui.R code on github
>
>Reproducible Pitch
>
>You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide)  to pitch a your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify or Rstudio Presenter with an html5 slide deck.
>
>Here's what you need
>1.5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
>
>2.Your presentation pushed to github or Rpubs
>
>3.A link to your github or Rpubs presentation pasted into the text box below
